# auto-tuning-fixer
A pretty lesser known feature of Windows 10 is auto-tuning.

Disabling auto-tuning on Windows will limit your internet speeds. This script checks to see if your auto-tuning level is enabled or not on Windows 10 and prompts if you want to enable it to fix your internet download speeds.

If you're having issues with slow download speeds or perhaps network performance, enabling auto-tuning could help.
